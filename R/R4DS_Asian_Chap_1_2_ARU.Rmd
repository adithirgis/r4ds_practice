Thanks for joining!

We'll be covering a different chapter of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund every Tuesday at 08:00 a.m. IST/ 02:30 a.m. UTC every week.

## What we'll learn

As Hadley and Garret say- 

> "You'll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most 
> useful structure, transform it, visualize it and model it."


> "These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will
> find the best practices for doing each of these things with R."

## The Model

---
## The Model

**Import** -- Import the data into R

**Tidy** -- Store the data in a consistent form

**Transform** -- Selecting in on observations of interest

**Visualize** -- Plot or visualise the data

**Model** -- Complimentary to visualisation, tool that answers questions of the data

**Communicate** -- Communicate findings to others

## The 80-20 Rule

> "You can tackle about 80% of every project using the tools that
> you'll learn in this book, but you'll need other tools to tackle the
> remaining 20%."

&nbsp;

[*Wickham & Grolemund*]

&nbsp;

While most of the analysis techniques used for a data science project are mentioned here, but we might still need to work out some analysis using different tools. 
---
## IMPORTANT!!

> "While it's tempting to skip the exercises, there's no better
> way to learn than practicing on real problems."

We can definitely refer to the [solution book](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/). (Thanks!)

But personally, I feel that trying to solve it on our own first will definitely help!

---
## Prerequisites

1. New to programming try [Hands on Programming with R](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449359019/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) by Garrett.

2. Download and install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)

3. Download and install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), an intergrated development environment.
---
## Prerequisites

To install the "tidyverse" (a collection of many amazing packages) package type:

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

Install these other packages the book uses as examples type:

`install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))`

## See you next week!

Next chapter - **Data Visualization**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = drv))
```
