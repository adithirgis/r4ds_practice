## Introduction

## Data Visualisation

Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?

 - `displ`, a car’s engine size, in litres.

 - `hwy`, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.

```{r cars}
mpg
summary(cars)
```



```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

The plot above shows a negative relationship between engine size (`displ`) and fuel efficiency (`hwy`). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel.

###  Exercises

`class` vs `drv`

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
nrow(mpg)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_count()
mpg %>%
  count(class, drv) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = drv)) +
    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```
In the previous plot, there are many missing tiles. These missing tiles represent unobserved combinations of `class` and `drv` values. These missing values are not unknown, but represent values of (`class`, `drv`) where `n = 0`. The `complete()` function in the tidyr package adds new rows to a data frame for missing combinations of columns. The following code adds rows for missing combinations of `class` and `drv` and uses the fill argument to set `n = 0` for those new rows.

```{r}
mpg %>%
  count(class, drv) %>%
  complete(class, drv, fill = list(n = 0)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = drv)) +
    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

### Aesthetic mappings

You can add a third variable, like `class`, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an aesthetic. An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points.


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

The colors reveal that many of the unusual points are two-seater cars. These cars don’t seem like hybrids, and are, in fact, sports cars! Sports cars have large engines like SUVs and pickup trucks, but small bodies like midsize and compact cars, which improves their gas mileage. In hindsight, these cars were unlikely to be hybrids since they have large engines.

The exact size of each point would reveal its class affiliation. We get a warning here, because mapping an unordered variable (`class`) to an ordered aesthetic (`size`) is not a good idea.

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))

```

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))

```

What happened to the SUVs? ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time. By default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic.

![Fig 2: Shapes in R](D:/Dropbox/ILKConsultancy/r4ds_practice/R/images/Fig2.JPG)

### Exercises

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
glimpse(mpg)

```

The argument `colour = "blue"` is included within the `mapping` argument, and as such, it is treated as an aesthetic, which is a mapping between a variable and a value. In the expression, `colour = "blue"`, `"blue"` is interpreted as a categorical variable which only takes a single value `"blue"`. If this is confusing, consider how `colour = 1:234` and `colour = 1` are interpreted by `aes()`.

Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = cty)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty)) +
  geom_point()
# ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = cty)) +
#   geom_point()
```

What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?
- Redundancy!

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = hwy, size = displ)) +
  geom_point()
```

What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)

- Stroke changes the size of the border for shapes (21-25). These are filled shapes in which the color and size of the border can differ from that of the filled interior of the shape.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", fill = "white", size = 5, stroke = 5)
```

What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = displ < 5)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Facets 

The first argument of `facet_wrap()` should be a formula, which you create with `~` followed by a variable name (here “formula” is the name of a data structure in R, not a synonym for “equation”). The variable that you pass to `facet_wrap()` should be discrete.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add `facet_grid()` to your plot call. The first argument of `facet_grid()` is also a formula. This time the formula should contain two variable names separated by a `~`.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

If you prefer to not facet in the rows or columns dimension, use a `.` instead of a variable name, e.g. `+ facet_grid(. ~ cyl)`.

### Exercises

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ displ)
```

What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean? How do they relate to this plot?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
```

The empty cells (facets) in this plot are combinations of drv and cyl that have no observations. These are the same locations in the scatter plot of drv and cyl that have no points.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

```



```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
```

What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

The symbol `.` ignores that dimension when faceting. For example, drv ~ . facet by values of drv on the y-axis.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)
```

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

Advantages of encoding `class` with facets instead of color include the ability to encode more distinct categories. For me, it is difficult to distinguish between the colors of `"midsize"` and `"minivan"`.

Given human visual perception, the max number of colors to use when encoding unordered categorical (qualitative) data is nine, and in practice, often much less than that. Displaying observations from different categories on different scales makes it difficult to directly compare values of observations across categories. However, it can make it easier to compare the shape of the relationship between the x and y variables across categories.

Disadvantages of encoding the `class` variable with facets instead of the color aesthetic include the difficulty of comparing the values of observations between categories since the observations for each category are on different plots. Using the same x- and y-scales for all facets makes it easier to compare values of observations across categories, but it is still more difficult than if they had been displayed on the same plot. Since encoding class within color also places all points on the same plot, it visualizes the unconditional relationship between the x and y variables; with facets, the unconditional relationship is no longer visualized since the points are spread across multiple plots.

The benefit of encoding a variable with facetting over encoding it with color increase in both the number of points and the number of categories. With a large number of points, there is often overlap. It is difficult to handle overlapping points with different colors color. Jittering will still work with color. But jittering will only work well if there are few points and the classes do not overlap much, otherwise, the colors of areas will no longer be distinct, and it will be hard to pick out the patterns of different categories visually. Transparency (`alpha`) does not work well with colors since the mixing of overlapping transparent colors will no longer represent the colors of the categories. Binning methods already use color to encode the density of points in the bin, so color cannot be used to encode categories.

As the number of categories increases, the difference between colors decreases, to the point that the color of categories will no longer be visually distinct.


Read ?facet_wrap. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t `facet_grid()` have nrow and ncol variables?

The arguments nrow (ncol) determines the number of rows (columns) to use when laying out the facets. It is necessary since `facet_wrap(`) only facets on one variable.

The `nrow` and `ncol` arguments are unnecessary for `facet_grid()` since the number of unique values of the variables specified in the function determines the number of rows and columns.


When using `facet_grid()` you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?
There will be more space for columns if the plot is laid out horizontally (landscape).

## Geometric objects

A geom is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
```
For these geoms, you can set the group aesthetic to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects. ggplot2 will draw a separate object for each unique value of the grouping variable. In practice, ggplot2 will automatically group the data for these geoms whenever you map an aesthetic to a discrete variable.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
              
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
    
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),
    show.legend = FALSE
  )
```
To display multiple geoms in the same plot, add multiple geom functions to `ggplot()`:
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

You can use the same idea to specify different `data` for each layer. Here, our smooth line displays just a subset of the `mpg` dataset, the subcompact cars. The local data argument in `geom_smooth()` overrides the global data argument in `ggplot()` for that layer only.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
```

### Exercises

Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv, colour = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), se = FALSE)
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv))
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = drv)) + 
  geom_point(stroke = 5, show.legend = FALSE)
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "white") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv))
```

## Statistical Functions 

Types of charts from stat algorithm-

- bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

- smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.

- boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```
