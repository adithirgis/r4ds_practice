## Organise your Data in R 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(nycflights13)
```


---
## Creating date/times

There are three types of date/time data that refer to an instant in time:

- A date. Tibbles print this as `<date>`.

- A time within a day. Tibbles print this as `<time>`.

- A date-time is a date plus a time: it uniquely identifies an instant in time (typically to the nearest second). Tibbles print this as `<dttm>`. Elsewhere in R these are called POSIXct, but I don’t think that’s a very useful name.
 
 
---
## Current date and time 


```{r}
today()

now()

```
 
---

# From strings

- They automatically work out the format once you specify the order of the component. 
- To use them, identify the order in which year, month, and day appear in your dates, then arrange “y”, “m”, and “d” in the same order.
- These functions also take unquoted numbers. This is the most concise way to create a single date/time object, as you might need when filtering date/time data. `ymd()` is short and unambiguous.
- Add time zone as well.

---

```{r}
ymd("2017-01-31")
mdy("January 31st, 2017")
dmy("31-Jan-2017")
ymd(20170131)
ymd_hms("2017-01-31 20:11:59")
mdy_hm("01/31/2017 08:01")
ymd(20170131, tz = "UTC")
```

---

# From individual components

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute) %>% 
  mutate(departure = make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute))
```

---

```{r}
make_datetime_100 <- function(year, month, day, time) {
  make_datetime(year, month, day, time %/% 100, time %% 100)
}

flights_dt <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_time), !is.na(arr_time)) %>% 
  mutate(
    dep_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, dep_time),
    arr_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, arr_time),
    sched_dep_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, sched_dep_time),
    sched_arr_time = make_datetime_100(year, month, day, sched_arr_time)
  ) %>% 
  select(origin, dest, ends_with("delay"), ends_with("time"))
flights_dt
```

---

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_time)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 86400) # 86400 seconds = 1 day
```

---

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  filter(dep_time < ymd(20130102)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_time)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 600) # 600 s = 10 minutes
```


--- 

#From other types

- Sometimes numeric offsets from the “Unix Epoch”, 1970-01-01. 
- If the offset is in seconds, use `as_datetime()`; if it’s in days, use `as_date()`.

```{r}
as_datetime(today())
as_date(now())
as_datetime(60 * 60 * 10)
as_date(365 * 10 + 2)
```


--- 

# Excerises 16.2.4

- What happens if you parse a string that contains invalid dates?


```{r}
ymd(c("2010-10-10", "bananas"))
```

--- 

# Excerises 16.2.4

- What does the `tzone` argument to `today()` do? Why is it important?


It determines the time-zone of the date. Since different time-zones can have different dates, the value of `today()` can vary depending on the time-zone specified.

--- 

# Excerises 16.2.4

Use the appropriate lubridate function to parse each of the following dates:

```{r}
d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014

mdy(d1)
ymd(d2)
dmy(d3)
mdy(d4)
mdy(d5)
```



---

# Date-time components

## Getting components

```{r}
datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56")
year(datetime)
month(datetime)
mday(datetime)
yday(datetime)
wday(datetime)
month(datetime, label = TRUE)
wday(datetime, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)

```


---

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(wday = wday(dep_time, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday)) +
    geom_bar()
```


---

# Rounding

- An alternative approach to plotting individual components is to round the date to a nearby unit of time, with `floor_date()`, `round_date()`, and `ceiling_date()`.

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  count(week = floor_date(dep_time, "week")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, n)) +
    geom_line()
```

---

# Setting components

```{r}
(datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56"))
year(datetime) <- 2020
datetime
month(datetime) <- 01
datetime
hour(datetime) <- hour(datetime) + 1
datetime
```

---

```{r}
update(datetime, year = 2020, month = 2, mday = 2, hour = 2)
ymd("2015-02-01") %>% 
  update(mday = 30)
ymd("2015-02-01") %>% 
  update(hour = 400)
```

# Exercises 16.3.4 

- How does the distribution of flight times within a day change over the course of the year?



--- 

# Time spans

- durations, which represent an exact number of seconds.
- periods, which represent human units like weeks and months.
- intervals, which represent a starting and ending point.

---

# Durations

- In R, when you subtract two dates, you get a `difftime` object.
- A `difftime` class object records a time span of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks.

```{r}
(h_age <- today() - ymd(19791014))
as.duration(h_age)
```

--- 

- Durations always record the time span in seconds. 
- Larger units are created by converting minutes, hours, days, weeks, and years to seconds at the standard rate (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in day, 7 days in a week, 365 days in a year).


```{r}
dseconds(15)
dminutes(10)
dhours(c(12, 24))
ddays(0:5)
dweeks(3)
dyears(1)
# Can add and subtract as well 
2 * dyears(1)
dyears(1) + dweeks(12) + dhours(15)
(tomorrow <- today() + ddays(1))
(last_year <- today() - dyears(1))
```

```{r}
one_pm <- ymd_hms("2016-03-12 13:00:00", tz = "Asia/Kolkata")
one_pm
one_pm + ddays(1)
```

---

# Periods

- Periods are time spans but don’t have a fixed length in seconds, instead they work with “human” times, like days and months.

```{r}
one_pm
one_pm + days(1)
```

--- 

```{r}
seconds(15)
minutes(10)
hours(c(12, 24))
days(7)
months(1:6)
weeks(3)
years(1)
# Can add and subtract as well 
10 * (months(6) + days(1))
days(50) + hours(25) + minutes(2)
```

---

```{r}
flights_dt <- flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(
    overnight = arr_time < dep_time,
    arr_time = arr_time + days(overnight * 1),
    sched_arr_time = sched_arr_time + days(overnight * 1)
  )

flights_dt %>% 
  filter(overnight, arr_time < dep_time)
```


---

# Intervals

```{r}
years(1) / days(1)
next_year <- today() + years(1)
(today() %--% next_year) %/% days(1)
```

---

# Summary

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0020136325ea844476bc61eb7e95d2ac5aeebf00/893e9/diagrams/datetimes-arithmetic.png")
```

--- 

- If you only care about physical time, use a duration.
- If you need to add human times, use a period.
- If you need to figure out how long a span is in human units, use an interval.

---

# Exercises 16.4.5

Why is there `months()` but no `dmonths()`?

- There is no unambiguous value of months in terms of seconds since months have differing numbers of days. Month is not defined independently. 

---

Explain `days(overnight * 1)` to someone who has just started learning R. How does it work?

- The variable overnight is equal to TRUE or FALSE. If it is an overnight flight, this becomes 1 day, and if not, then overnight = 0, and no days are added to the date.

```{r}
glimpse(flights)
days(flights_dt$overnight * 1)
```

---

Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in 2015. Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in the current year.

```{r}
# indexing starts from 0

ymd("2015-01-01") + months(0:11)
floor_date(today(), unit = "year") + months(0:11)
```

---

Write a function that given your birthday (as a date), returns how old you are in years.

- `%--%` creates an interval.
```{r}
age <- function(bday) {
  (bday %--% today()) %/% years(1)
}

age(ymd("1995-3-27"))
```

---

Why can’t `(today() %--% (today() + years(1)) / months(1)` work?


```{r}
(today() %--% (today() + years(1))) / months(1)
```

- The interval has an exact number of seconds. 
- The denominator of the expression, months(1), is a period, which is meaningful 
to humans but not defined in terms of an exact number of seconds. 
- Months can be 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, so it is not clear what months(1) divide by.

---

# Time zones

- You can find out what R thinks your current time zone is with `Sys.timezone()`. 

```{r}
length(OlsonNames())
head(OlsonNames())
```

---

# Time zones

- Unless otherwise specified, lubridate always uses UTC.
- Keep the instant in time the same, and change how it’s displayed. Use this when the instant is correct, but you want a more natural display.

```{r}
(x1 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-01 12:00:00", tz = "America/New_York"))
(x2 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-01 18:00:00", tz = "Europe/Copenhagen"))
(x3 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-02 04:00:00", tz = "Pacific/Auckland"))
(x4 <- c(x1, x2, x3))
x4a <- with_tz(x4, tzone = "Australia/Lord_Howe")
x4a
x4a - x4
```

---

- Change the underlying instant in time. Use this when you have an instant that has been labelled with the incorrect time zone, and you need to fix it.

```{r}
x4b <- force_tz(x4, tzone = "Australia/Lord_Howe")
x4b
x4b - x4
```
